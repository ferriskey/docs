# Documentation

Product documentation plays a fundamental role by serving as a comprehensive guide for users.

Its main purpose is to enable quick and efficient familiarisation, detail features for optimal everyday use, and provide clear solutions for troubleshooting common issues.

---

## Folder Structure

To organise the documentation, each section or complete documentation must be contained in its own folder. This folder must include a `_default.md` file that acts as the entry point or definition of the section.

### Configuration

Each documentation folder must contain a configuration file named `_default.md`. This file defines the metadata for the section, and its front matter must follow the following structure :

:::codegroup labels=[Tree]

```
├── content/
│  ├── [...page]
│  └── docs/
│     └── my_doc/
│        ├── _default.mdx 👈 Configuration file
│        ├── first_file.mdx
│        └── second_file.mdx
```

:::

The configuration file is structured in the form of standardised `frontmatter`, which allows various information to be defined.

:::codegroup labels=[_example.mdx, Collection]

```mdx
---
label: My documentation
directory: my_doc
description: My doc description
permalink: my-doc
icon: lucide:cuboid
collection:
  - first_file
  - second_file
---
```

```ts
export const docDefaultSchema = z.object({
  label: z.string(),
  description: z.string(),
  permalink: z.string(),
  icon: z.string().optional(),
  directory: z.string(),
  collection: z.array(z.string()),
});
```

:::

| Property      | Description                                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `label`       | Display collection name                          |
| `description` | Description of your collection                   |
| `permalink`   | Collection url                                   |
| `icon`        | Icon Using `iconify` library                     |
| `directory`   | Directory name inside `docs/`                    |
| `collection`  | Collection folder or items, used to define order |

---

### Writing content

The other Markdown files (`.md` or `.mdx`) in the same folder represent the individual pages of the documentation. The front matter of each of these files must comply with the following schema :

:::codegroup labels=[first_file.mdx, Collection]

```mdx
---
title: First file
description: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
permalink: first-file
icon: lucide:file
visibility:
  - navbar
---
```

```typescript
export const docSchema = z.object({
  title: z.string(),
  description: z.string(),
  permalink: z.string().optional(),
  icon: z.string().optional(),
  visibility: z.array(z.enum(["navbar"])).default([]),
});
```

Your file `first_file.md` will be accessible via [`http://localhost:4321/docs/my-doc/first-file`](http://localhost:4321/docs/my-doc/first-file)
